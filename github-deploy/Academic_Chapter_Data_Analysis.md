# Chapter: Data Architecture and Cultural Distribution in the Interactive Map of Iberian Songs

## Quantitative Analysis of the Digital Collection

The interactive map of Iberian songs presents a substantial digital corpus comprising 700 geographically-verified musical compositions distributed across the Iberian Peninsula, representing 87.4% of the total database of 801 songs. This collection demonstrates significant geographic and cultural diversity, with Spanish traditions accounting for 641 songs (91.6%) spanning 13 distinct autonomous communities, while Portuguese musical heritage contributes 59 songs (8.4%) across 5 regional divisions. The geographic distribution reveals notable concentration patterns, with Cantabria hosting the largest regional collection of 376 songs (58.7% of Spanish content), followed by Castilla y Le√≥n with 184 compositions (28.7%). This distribution pattern reflects both historical collection practices and the regional density of preserved folk traditions, providing researchers with particularly rich datasets for comparative analysis within these dominant cultural zones.

## Pedagogical Classification and Thematic Taxonomy

The corpus demonstrates comprehensive pedagogical accessibility through a three-tier difficulty classification system that encompasses all 700 mapped songs: 498 compositions (71.1%) are classified as medium difficulty, suitable for intermediate musical study; 105 songs (15.0%) present advanced challenges for skilled practitioners; and 97 pieces (13.9%) offer accessible entry points for beginners and educational contexts. Complementing this pedagogical framework, the platform incorporates a sophisticated thematic taxonomy applied to 570 songs (81.4% of the mapped collection), organized into six primary cultural categories. Religious and ceremonial traditions dominate the thematic landscape, with "Honorific - Religious" content representing 192 compositions (33.7% of themed songs) and "Ritual" practices encompassing 111 pieces (19.5%). Personal and social dimensions emerge through "Affect & desires" (89 songs, 15.6%) and "Family" themes (52 songs, 9.1%), while cultural symbolism appears in "Symbolic Traditional" (72 songs, 12.6%) and "Natural Imagery" (54 songs, 9.5%) categories, collectively establishing a comprehensive framework for ethnomusicological analysis and cultural heritage preservation.

## Cross-Dimensional Analysis and Educational Applications

The intersection of geographic, pedagogical, and thematic classifications reveals sophisticated patterns that enhance the platform's utility for diverse academic applications. The most substantial cross-dimensional grouping emerges from Cantabria's medium-difficulty repertoire (267 songs), providing extensive material for intermediate regional studies, while the combination of Cantabrian religious traditions (123 songs) offers concentrated resources for sacred music scholarship. These quantitative distributions enable multiple pedagogical approaches: regional comparative studies across 18 distinct geographic zones; progressive difficulty-based curricula supporting learner development from beginner (97 songs) through advanced (105 songs) levels; and thematic investigations spanning six major cultural categories. The platform's filtering architecture supports over 100 meaningful combinations of country, region, difficulty, and theme parameters, establishing a robust foundation for customized educational experiences that can accommodate diverse research interests, pedagogical objectives, and cultural heritage preservation goals while maintaining scholarly rigor through geographically-verified, culturally-contextualized musical content.
