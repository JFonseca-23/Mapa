# Chapter: Interactive Digital Platforms for Cultural Heritage Education: The Case of the Iberian Traditional Songs Map

## Abstract

This chapter examines an innovative interactive digital platform that combines geographic visualization, musical notation, audio playback, and data analytics to create an immersive educational experience centered on Iberian traditional songs. Through a comprehensive analysis of the platform's technical architecture, pedagogical affordances, and potential applications, this study demonstrates how technology-enhanced learning environments can transform traditional musicology and cultural heritage education. The platform, featuring over 800 traditional songs from Spain and Portugal with geographic mapping, thematic clustering, difficulty analysis, and interactive musical notation, exemplifies how digital humanities tools can bridge the gap between academic research and public education.

## 1. Introduction

The digitization of cultural heritage has fundamentally transformed how we preserve, study, and disseminate traditional knowledge. In the field of ethnomusicology and cultural studies, digital platforms have emerged as powerful tools for making intangible cultural heritage accessible to diverse audiences while maintaining scholarly rigor. This chapter analyzes an innovative interactive platform designed to explore Iberian traditional songs through a multi-layered digital interface that combines geographic information systems (GIS), musical informatics, machine learning, and web-based technologies.

The platform under examination represents a convergence of several educational and technological trends: the spatial turn in digital humanities, the democratization of cultural heritage through digital platforms, the application of computational methods to musicological research, and the development of interactive learning environments. By integrating these elements, the platform offers a case study for understanding how digital tools can enhance cultural heritage education and create new forms of scholarly engagement.

## 2. Platform Architecture and Features

### 2.1 Technical Infrastructure

The interactive map platform is built using modern web technologies that enable cross-platform accessibility and real-time interactivity. The core architecture consists of:

**Frontend Technologies:**
- HTML5 and CSS3 for responsive web design
- JavaScript for dynamic user interactions
- Leaflet.js for interactive mapping functionality
- Verovio toolkit for MEI (Music Encoding Initiative) score rendering
- Tone.js for audio synthesis and MIDI playback

**Data Layer:**
- JSON files for geographic mappings linking songs to specific regions
- MEI (Music Encoding Initiative) format for musical notation storage
- CSV data containing lyrical analysis and thematic clustering results
- Metadata structures supporting multi-dimensional song categorization

**Computational Components:**
- Machine learning clustering algorithms for thematic analysis
- Automated musical difficulty assessment algorithms
- Geographic coordinate generation for precise song localization
- Real-time filtering and search capabilities

### 2.2 Core Functionalities

The platform offers several interconnected features that support different learning objectives:

**Geographic Visualization:**
The primary interface is an interactive map of the Iberian Peninsula displaying songs as geographic markers. Users can explore the spatial distribution of musical traditions across 17 Spanish regions (including Andalucía, Cataluña, Castilla y León, etc.) and 5 Portuguese regions (Braga, Faro, Viana do Castelo, Viseu, Porto). This geographic approach enables users to understand the regional variations in musical traditions and observe patterns of cultural diffusion.

**Multi-dimensional Filtering:**
The platform provides sophisticated filtering mechanisms across four dimensions:
1. **Geographic filtering** by country and region
2. **Difficulty filtering** based on computational analysis of musical complexity
3. **Thematic filtering** using machine learning clustering of lyrical content
4. **Cross-dimensional filtering** allowing users to explore intersections between these categories

**Interactive Musical Notation:**
Each song is encoded in MEI format, enabling high-quality rendering of musical notation directly in the web browser. The Verovio toolkit provides scalable vector graphics representation of musical scores, maintaining readability across different screen sizes and zoom levels.

**Audio Synthesis and Playback:**
The platform includes a sophisticated audio engine capable of:
- Real-time MIDI synthesis from MEI notation
- Variable tempo control (30-300 BPM)
- Metronome functionality for educational purposes
- Play, pause, and stop controls for detailed musical analysis

### 2.3 Data Organization and Scope

The platform currently contains 798 traditional songs, comprising approximately 742 Spanish and 59 Portuguese compositions. This collection represents a significant corpus of Iberian folk music, with temporal coverage spanning from early 20th-century field recordings to contemporary documentation efforts.

**Thematic Classification:**
Through computational analysis of lyrical content, songs are categorized into six major themes:
- Affect & desires
- Family
- Honorific - Religious
- Natural Imagery
- Ritual
- Symbolic Traditional

**Difficulty Assessment:**
An automated analysis system evaluates musical complexity based on:
- Meter complexity (binary vs. ternary vs. complex rhythms)
- Harmonic complexity (number of accidentals, modality)
- Melodic range (pitch span in semitones)

Songs are classified into three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) to support differentiated instruction and progressive learning.

## 3. Pedagogical Affordances and Educational Applications

### 3.1 Constructivist Learning Framework

The platform's design aligns with constructivist learning principles by enabling users to actively explore and construct knowledge through interaction. Rather than presenting information in a linear, predetermined sequence, the platform allows learners to navigate content based on their interests and learning objectives. This approach supports several key constructivist principles:

**Active Knowledge Construction:** Users actively engage with the material by selecting filters, exploring geographic regions, and interacting with musical notation. The platform responds dynamically to user choices, creating a personalized learning experience.

**Contextual Learning:** By presenting songs within their geographic and cultural contexts, the platform helps learners understand how musical traditions emerge from and relate to specific places and communities.

**Multiple Perspectives:** The multi-dimensional filtering system allows users to approach the same musical content from different analytical perspectives, supporting the constructivist principle that knowledge can be understood through multiple lenses.

### 3.2 Multimodal Learning Support

The platform's integration of visual, auditory, and interactive elements supports diverse learning styles and provides multiple pathways for understanding musical and cultural content:

**Visual Learning:**

### 3.3 Inquiry-Based Learning Opportunities

The platform's design naturally supports inquiry-based learning by enabling users to formulate and investigate research questions across multiple dimensions:

**Geographic Inquiry:**
- "How do musical traditions vary across different Spanish regions?"
- "What are the similarities and differences between Portuguese and Spanish folk songs?"
- "Are certain themes more prevalent in specific geographic areas?"

**Thematic Analysis:**
- "How do songs about family differ from religious songs in their musical characteristics?"
- "What musical features are associated with songs about natural imagery?"
- "How does musical complexity relate to thematic content?"

**Comparative Studies:**
- "Do more complex songs cluster in certain geographic regions?"
- "How do contemporary documentation practices differ across regions?"
- "What patterns emerge when examining the intersection of geography, theme, and difficulty?"
