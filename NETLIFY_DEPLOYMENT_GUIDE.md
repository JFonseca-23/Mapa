- ✅ **Drag & drop deployment** - No need for 16 separate uploads
- ✅ **Faster deployment** - Single upload process
- ✅ **Better performance** - Built-in CDN

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Netlify account (free)
- All files in `/Users/joaofonseca/Desktop/Mapa final/github-deploy/` directory
- Web browser

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Netlify Deployment

### Step 1: Prepare Deployment Folder
Your files are already organized perfectly in the `github-deploy` directory!

### Step 2: Create Netlify Account
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Click "Sign up" (free account)
3. Sign up with GitHub, email, or other preferred method

### Step 3: Deploy via Drag & Drop

#### Option A: Manual Drag & Drop (Recommended)
1. **Log into Netlify**
2. **Go to Sites dashboard**
3. **Look for the drag & drop area** that says:
   ```
   "Want to deploy a new site without connecting to Git?
   Drag and drop your site output folder here"
   ```
4. **Drag your entire `github-deploy` folder** onto this area
5. **Wait for upload** (may take 5-10 minutes for 801 files)
6. **Get your site URL** - Netlify will provide a random URL like `https://amazing-song-platform-123456.netlify.app`

#### Option B: Zip Upload Method
1. **Create a zip file** of your `github-deploy` folder
2. **Go to Netlify dashboard**
3. **Click "Deploy manually"**
4. **Upload the zip file**
5. **Wait for deployment**

### Step 4: Custom Site Name (Optional)
1. **Go to Site settings**
2. **Click "Change site name"**
3. **Choose a name** like `iberian-songs-platform`
4. **Your URL becomes**: `https://iberian-songs-platform.netlify.app`

### Step 5: Test Your Deployment
1. **Visit your Netlify URL**
2. **Test Portuguese songs** (59 files)
3. **Test Spanish songs** (742 files across all regions)
4. **Verify map functionality**
5. **Check responsive design**

## 🔧 Netlify Configuration

### Recommended Settings
Create a `netlify.toml` file in your root directory:

```toml
[build]
  publish = "."

[[headers]]
  for = "/*.mei"
  [headers.values]
    Content-Type = "application/xml"
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000"

[[headers]]
  for = "/*.json"
  [headers.values]
    Content-Type = "application/json"
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=86400"
```

### File Structure for Netlify
```
netlify-deploy/
├── index.html
├── package.json
├── netlify.toml (optional)
├── *.json (mapping files)
├── Portuguese/
│   └── 59 .mei files
├── Spanish_part_01/
│   └── 49 .mei files
├── Spanish_part_02/
│   └── 50 .mei files
├── ... (all 15 Spanish folders)
└── Spanish_part_15/
    └── 50 .mei files
```

## 🎵 File Organization Benefits

**Your current structure is PERFECT for Netlify:**
- All 742 Spanish MEI files in organized folders ✅
- All 59 Portuguese MEI files ready ✅
- Core application files prepared ✅
- No need to modify your current organization ✅

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: Files not loading
- **Solution**: Check file paths in browser console
- **Fix**: Ensure MEI files maintain relative paths

**Issue**: Slow loading
- **Solution**: Netlify's CDN should handle this automatically
- **Optimization**: MEI files are already optimized

**Issue**: MIME type errors
- **Solution**: Add the `netlify.toml` configuration above

### Performance Optimization
```javascript
// Add to your index.html if needed
<script>
// Preload critical MEI files
const criticalMeiFiles = [
    'Portuguese/PT-1998-XX-DM-001.mei',
    'Spanish_part_01/ES-1913-B-JSV-001.mei'
];
criticalMeiFiles.forEach(file => {
    const link = document.createElement('link');
    link.rel = 'preload';
    link.href = file;
    link.as = 'fetch';
    document.head.appendChild(link);
});
</script>
```
