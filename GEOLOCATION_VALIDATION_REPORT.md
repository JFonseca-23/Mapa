- Uses filename-based hashing for consistent placement
- Distributes songs within 40% of region bounds from center
- Ensures all coordinates fall within valid geographic boundaries
- Prevents coordinate collisions through deterministic offsets

### ID Transformation System
The song ID transformation correctly:
- Converts MEI filenames to standardized IDs
- Maintains compatibility with thematic classification system
- Handles both Spanish (ES_) and Portuguese (PT_) prefixes
- Supports all filtering dimensions (country, region, difficulty, theme)

### Region Mapping System
All region mappings are verified as:
- Geographically accurate
- Properly bounded
- Compatible with actual song metadata
- Supporting both countries' administrative divisions
